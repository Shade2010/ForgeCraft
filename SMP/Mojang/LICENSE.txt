From here on "we" means the party using material from the company "Mojang AB"

The files in this folder and its subfolders are only partially the work of the ForgeCraft development team.
They are heavily based on work by Mojang, AB.  Please, respect that these algorithms represent that hard
work of Notch and other developers at Mojang.  They are not meant to be open source, and should not be
redistributed.  On the Behave of Forgeware Int, the use these files are not an attempt to compete with Mojang, but
bettering the Minecraft community and thus increasing profits for Mojang.  We consider this project a thank
you to Mojang for their wonderful product: a compliment to it, not a replacement for it.  These files were
released with that intent in mind.  We cannot imagine why someone would use these files abusively, or even
how, but please, do not be the person to surprise us.
